With concerns about COVID-19's exponential growth over the past few months and statewide quarantines taking place, we recognize how difficult it has been for communities to stay connected with each other, maintain health and wellness, and continue on with some semblance of normal life. From student responsibilities and work life to checking in with family and keeping up with friends, it can be easy to become overwhelmed with the drastic changes occurring everyday.

Social media platforms like Instagram have already seen a variety of trending challenges from those choosing to remain indoors during this difficult time. Push up challenges and embarrassing old photos show us that the young community continues trying to find unique ways to cope with social distancing and to spend their time. People on YouTube have started sharing videos about how they spend their days inside, things such as "quarantine recipes" or developing film at home or self-care practices at home.
